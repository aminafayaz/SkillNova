### Project Description
SkillNova is a platform that enables individuals to exchange services and skills using time as a currency instead of money.
It fosters community collaboration by allowing members to give and receive help based on mutual respect and equity.

### The Problem statement
Traditional economies limit access to skills and services for those without financial resources, creating inequities and missed opportunities for collaboration.
SkillNova addresses this by using time as a currency, enabling everyone to contribute and benefit equally, regardless of their financial situation.

### The Solution
We’re flipping the script on traditional economies by making time the ultimate currency! 
On SkillNova, you don’t need money—just your unique skills and a willingness to share.
Spend an hour teaching guitar, earn an hour of yoga lessons in return.
It’s like bartering, but way cooler—where everyone’s time is valued equally, and the possibilities for collaboration are endless!
